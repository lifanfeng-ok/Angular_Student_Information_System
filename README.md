The system is used to display the grades and other information of students in a certain college. Since the server is no longer open, and the server data was not saved locally in time, `the specific information cannot be displayed now`.

The main function: 
* `Information table section`: View basic student information such as majors and classes. View student grades and GPAs by subject, view overall grades for a course, and grades across majors. View the overall grades of a class such as average GPA, student with the highest GPA, students with the most failed subjects, etc.
* `Dashboard section`: Visualize important data with charts. It is convenient for teachers to make scientific and rational decision-making. Such as the distribution of students by province, Top 10 GPA courses, and the average GPA of each major.
